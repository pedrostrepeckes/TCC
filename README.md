# TCC
This is part of my Undergrad Thesis. 
Here you'll find, for now, just the changes that I did in the LeNet5 and VGG19 to check the difference in the results.

You can check using my Jupyter Notebook hosted in the Google Colab.

The codes that you are going to find here are all about modifications of the abovementioned Architectures. The ending of the Filename, e.g. "*_arch.ipynb"  or "*_epoch.ipynb", shows which modifications were made in the code.

All codes you can try using Google Colab, on the top of every code there is a button to try it.
